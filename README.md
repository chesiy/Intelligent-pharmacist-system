# Neo4j-flask
---------------------
## discription
This is a project for PRP, which uses Neo4j for database, flask for web.  
I learn to code in python for the first time, learn to handle database for the first time, learn to construct a web for the first time.  
However, it is an interesting journey rather than an arduous way.
