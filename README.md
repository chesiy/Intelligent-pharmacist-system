# Neo4j-flask
---------------------
## discription
This is a project for PRP, which uses Neo4j for database, flask for web.  
I learn to code in python for the first time, learn to handle database for the first time, learn to construct a web for the first time.

The basic structure has been constructed well, but for robustness of this website, more works should be done. What's more, task 2 is still under development, PEOPLE, USAGE and PRODUCT haven't been considered.

Task 1 has been finished I think. I have to thank Peter so much for his helping me construct the table in html, which makes my website looks much better. As for task 2, PRODUCT and USAGE are almost finished.
